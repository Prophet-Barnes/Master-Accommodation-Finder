# Master-Accommodation-Finder
This project aims at automating the process of continuous monitoring of the offers for apartments on Stångåstaden, Heimstaden and Studentbostäder for the set requirements to provide the user with the ability of efficient time management using web scrapping using the Python package – Selenium and integration of Telegram bots to generate notifications.

The predecessor of this project, [Accommodation Direct Monitor](https://github.com/Prophet-Barnes/Accommodation-Direct-Monitor), mainly consisted of students as their target audience. So, although the project has tremendous significance for students of [Linköping University]((https://liu.se/en) in urgent need of accommodation, the applicability of the project has a big scope of improvement.

This project targets the needs of every individual with the permit to be a residence of Sweden, thus increasing its potential.

The scripting was done so that the program only shows relevant offers on the three websites. On Heimstaden, it skims out the offers based on their location, number of rooms, and maximum rent and on Stångåstaden, based on the number of rooms while displaying the location, the top three points and whether the last date to apply for the offer is within 3 days. As an additional feature, the program also notifies about the offers on Studentbostäder similar to the case in Stångåstaden, which opens greater number of options for student users.
